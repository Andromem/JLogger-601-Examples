# LMIC (MCCI) LoRaWan Example
This is example shows how to use the JLogger-601 with the MCCI Arduino-LMIC library. It is tested with version 3.2.0, which is fully LoRaWan compliant. It is based on the clasic LMIC example that you may have seen before, but includes (safely) sleeping and processing downlinks, among other things.
